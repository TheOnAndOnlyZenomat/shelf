# Very much WIP

This is a commandline manager for your book library. It eventually aims to provide the possibility to track:
* your read books
* the ones you are reading
* the ones you have on your list
* the individual read status
* a personal raiting

and if I am toatly motivated also automatic pulling of metadata for books from the internet.
